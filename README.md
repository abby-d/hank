# hank

A prototype to see if I can fine-tune an LLM into a style guide editor.

## Disclaimers & disclosures

Hello! This is Kayce Basques. I own this repository. I work for Google.
`hank` is a personal experiment. I have not received approval from Google
to open source this project and work on it publicly. You should assume
that Google can assert ownership over all work that I do if it wants to.
If anything goes wrong, then it's obviously my fault, not Google's, since
I didn't seek out approval from Google to work on `hank`. If any of this might
be a problem for you, then please do not contribute to this repository!

## Setup

```
source init.sh
```

## Create a fine-tuned model

```
source create.sh <name>
```

## Why "hank"?

In honor of Hank "I Am The Bat" Venture.
